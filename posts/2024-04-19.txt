Neocities arc
Hey all, Bepis here. My website is LIVE. NOW. You're looking at it so clearly I don't need to tell you this, but whatever. It's on Neocities because it's easy and it's peasy
I've been working on the outline for my comic for, like, forever, but haven't gotten anywhere. The best way to fix that is probably to make something concrete, i.e. <i>a single page!</i> And for that I need a website.
It'll come out.. eventually. Probably <b>next week</b> but no promises.
Once I figure out how to have music on here, since Neocities doesn't like hosting that, I can also put music I make on here, which'll be aweseome and fun
